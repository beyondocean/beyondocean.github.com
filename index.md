# Welcome #
This website is the Homepage of [Dr. Jun Xiong](/cv.html).

You will mostly find some information [about me](/about.html) and things I want to [share](eblog.html#share) with the rest of the world. This site is also a portal to some of my [tiny projects](#project) and to some interesting [learning material](eblog.html#learn).

If you have any comments about this website, Pls don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:jun.xiong1981@gmail.com). I'm also glad of hearing about any English mistakes, inaccuracy or broken things on this website. 

Welcome to BTO and enjoy your visits!
